I am a physical therapist currently pursuing a PhD in Movement and Cognitive Rehabilitation Science at the University of Texas at Austin. My clinical experience has been among a general outpatient population and afforded me the opportunity to become a Board Certified Specialist in Orthopedic Physical Therapy. Prior to becoming a physical therapist I worked in pension consulting as an actuary and have retained a love for data, statistics and programming. My intention during my PhD is to clarify how abnormal trunk movement following stroke can provide useful insights into underlying impairments, and potentially inform novel rehab strategies to improve walking ability.
