I am a physical therapist currently pursuing a PhD in Rehabilitation and Movement Science at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to becoming a physical therapist I worked in pension consulting as an actuary. Despite my experience as a clinician I have retained a love for data, statistics and programming. I look forward to merging my varied interests into a singular research path.
